            <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook udon in boiling water, stirring occasionally,
                 until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
                <li>While noodles are cooking, blend vegetable oil, cornstarch, garlic, and ginger together in a large bowl 
                until cornstarch is dissolved. Mix in frozen vegetables, tossing to lightly coat.</li>
                <li>Whisk soy sauce, water, vinegar, and sugar together in a small bowl.</li>
                <li>Heat sesame oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Cook and stir pork strips in the hot oil until just browned, 
                5 to 7 minutes. Add frozen vegetables and cook, stirring constantly to prevent burning, about 2 minutes. Stir in 
                soy sauce mixture. Add drained udon and stir-fry until vegetables are tender and pork strips are no longer pink in the centers, about 2 minutes more.</li>
